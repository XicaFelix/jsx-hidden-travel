        They are currently near {location} and have a budget of {budget_range}. 
        Suggest a few cool, unique, and unforgettable activities they could do nearby. 
        Make sure the activities are fun, not too common, and ideally a little quirky or surprising. 
        Provide a variety of suggestions like visiting an unusual bar, a cool local event, a hidden gem, 
        or something out-of-the-ordinary like an interactive experience or an outdoor adventure. 
        Keep it light-hearted, spontaneous, and memorable, but also ensure it's something that can easily be done 
        without long wait times or overwhelming crowds. The suggestions should fit the vibe of a local explorer!
